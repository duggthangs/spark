# IAEE Agent Guide: Generating Interactive Plans

IAEE (Interactive Agent Experience Engine) replaces static markdown plans with deterministic, delightful, wizard-style experiences. As an agent, your goal is to emit structured JSON that IAEE can render for a human to review.

## 1. The IAEE Lifecycle
1. **Emit**: You generate a JSON file following the [Experience Schema](../engine/schema.ts).
2. **Run**: The user executes `iaee run your-plan.json`.
3. **Interact**: The user steps through your plan, making choices, reordering priorities, or editing code.
4. **Synthesize**: Upon submission, the CLI outputs a **Markdown Summary** (generated by [compiler.ts](../engine/compiler.ts)) back to you.
5. **Apply**: you read the summary and apply the user's decisions to the codebase.

## 2. Generation Rules
- **Exactly One Decision Section**: Every experience must end with a `type: "decision"` section. This is the final gate for approval.
- **Section IDs**: Use stable, descriptive IDs (e.g., `select-database`, `priority-list`). These IDs are the keys in the result payload.
- **Context is Key**: Use `type: "info"` sections early in the wizard to frame the problem before asking for decisions.

## 3. Supported Experiences
For a full list of interactive types (Kanban, Data Mapper, API Builder, etc.) and their data structures, refer directly to the **[Zod Schema Definitions](../engine/schema.ts)**.

## 4. Tips for Delight
- **Start with Info**: Don't jump straight into choices. Contextualize the plan first.
- **Use Live Components**: If proposing a UI change, use `live-component` so the user can "feel" the layout.
- **Use Code Selector**: When proposing multiple implementation options (algorithms, patterns, utilities), use `code-selector` so the user can compare, select, and customize.
- **Group Logic**: Use `kanban` for prioritization instead of simple lists.
